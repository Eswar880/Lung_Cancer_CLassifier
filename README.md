# Lung_Cancer_CLassifier
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify lung CT scan images into two categories: malignant and benign. It is designed to help automate and enhance early lung cancer diagnosis using image-based machine learning techniques.
